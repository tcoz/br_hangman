# br_hangman

Sample of stateful web hangman app, written up quickly in python, nothing fancy. 

Uses Flask as the web request/response mechanism and to hold running state, nothing else. 

Client VERY basic, old-school JS/HTML, deliberately down-version. 

Install Flask: "pip install Flask". You may need sudo, depending on your rig. 

Pull down code, put in a directory, from that root run "python main.py"

Hit localhost:5000 and you're up and running.
